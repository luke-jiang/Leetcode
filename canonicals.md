## Trie:
Trie is best used for solving ... kinds of problems. **q208_implement_trie** implements a basic trie data structure and the essential interface: `insert` and `search`.

## Backtracking & Combinationals:
The backtracking and combinational problems have the following pattern: give a set of candidates S, draw k elements out of S with/without replacement. Find all possible results. The output set may be required to remove duplicate combinations. **q39_combination_sum** gives the basic pattern to this kind of problems and **q39_combination_sum_ii** describes the technique of avoiding including duplicates to the result.

## Tree Traversal:
In-order traversal using stack **q230_kth_smallest_number_in_bst** and **q94_binary_tree_in_order_traversal** and q98

## Monotonic Stack Next Greater Element:
The Monotonic Stack is useful to find the first left/right greater/smaller element of
nums[i], where nums is an unsorted array. The stack stores the indices of candidate
boundaries and the value of

Using stack to find the next greater element in an array.
