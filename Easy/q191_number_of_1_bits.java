// [Bitwise]

/** Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and return the number of '1' bits it has
  * (also known as the Hamming weight).
  *
  * Example 1:
  * Input: 00000000000000000000000000001011
  * Output: 3
  * Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits
