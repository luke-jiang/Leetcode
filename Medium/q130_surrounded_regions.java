// [DFS]

/** Given a 2D board containing 'X' and 'O' (the letter O), capture all regions surrounded by 'X'.
  * A region is captured by flipping all 'O's into 'X's in that surrounded region.
  *
  * Example:

      X X X X
      X O O X
      X X O X
      X O X X

  * After running your function, the board should be:

      X X X X
      X X X X
      X X X X
      X O X X
      
  * Explanation:
  * Surrounded regions shouldnâ€™t be on the border, which means that any 'O' on the border of the board
  * are not flipped to 'X'. Any 'O' that is not on the border and it is not connected to an 'O' on the
  * border will be flipped to 'X'. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected
  * horizontally or vertically.
